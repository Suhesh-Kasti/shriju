Today I helped a client set up their WiFi and learned some interesting things about WiFi channels and common misconceptions about 5G vs 5GHz.

## WiFi Channels Explained

WiFi networks operate on specific frequency channels. I learned that:

1. **2.4GHz band** has 14 channels (though only 1-11 are used in the US)
2. **5GHz band** has many more channels (36-165 depending on region)

The key insight: **Adjacent channels overlap and cause interference!** For 2.4GHz networks, only channels 1, 6, and 11 don't overlap with each other.

Here's a visual representation of 2.4GHz channel overlap:

```
Channel:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11
         |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
         |←——— Channel 1 ———→|
                     |←——— Channel 6 ———→|
                                 |←——— Channel 11 ——→|
```

## 5G vs 5GHz: Not the Same Thing!

My client was confused about this, so I explained:

| 5G | 5GHz WiFi |
|---|---|
| Cellular network technology | WiFi frequency band |
| For mobile data (phones) | For local wireless networks |
| Requires cellular service | Requires WiFi router |
| Long range, varies by type | Short range, better indoors |
| Provided by carriers (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) | Set up in your home/office |

## Setting Up a Client's WiFi

When setting up the client's WiFi, I followed these steps:

1. **Channel Selection**: Used a WiFi analyzer app to find the least congested channels
2. **Band Selection**: Set up both 2.4GHz (for range) and 5GHz (for speed)
3. **Password Security**: Created a strong password using a mix of characters
4. **Device Connection**: Helped connect all their devices to the new network
5. **Signal Testing**: Checked signal strength throughout their home

## Best Practices I Learned

1. For 2.4GHz, stick to channels 1, 6, or 11 to avoid interference
2. 5GHz is faster but has shorter range and doesn't penetrate walls as well
3. If you have many neighbors, 5GHz is often less congested
4. Router placement matters a lot - central, elevated locations work best
5. Regularly update router firmware for security and performance

This experience taught me that a little technical knowledge can make a big difference in WiFi performance. The client was thrilled with the improved speed and reliability after these simple adjustments!
