#### Project Overview

Sunrise Corporation LLC, a real estate development company, needed to establish a stronger social media presence to showcase their properties and connect with potential clients. I was responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive social media strategy across multiple platforms.

#### Project Scope

- Content creation and curation for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn
- Social media strategy development
- Community management and engagement
- Analytics tracking and reporting
- Paid social media campaign management
- Crisis communication planning

#### Strategy Development

The social media strategy was built around four key pillars:

1. **Property Showcases**: High-quality visual content highlighting Sunrise's properties
2. **Market Insights**: Educational content about real estate trends and investment opportunities
3. **Corporate Culture**: Behind-the-scenes content showcasing the company's values and team
4. **Client Success Stories**: Testimonials and case studies from satisfied clients

#### Content Creation

I developed various content types to maintain audience engagement:

| Content Type | Purpose | Frequency |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Property Highlights | Showcase available properties | 3× weekly |
| Market Updates | Share industry news and trends | 2× weekly |
| Team Spotlights | Humanize the brand | 1× weekly |
| Client Testimonials | Build trust | 2× monthly |
| Educational Infographics | Provide value to followers | 1× weekly |
| Live Q&A Sessions | Engage directly with audience | 1× monthly |

#### Implementation and Results

Over a six-month period, the social media management resulted in:

- **Instagram**: 127% increase in followers, 89% increase in engagement
- **Facebook**: 78% increase in page likes, 112% increase in post reach
- **LinkedIn**: 95% increase in followers, 156% increase in post impressions
- **Lead Generation**: 43% of new client inquiries attributed to social media
- **Brand Awareness**: Significant improvement in brand recognition metrics
