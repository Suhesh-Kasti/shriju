# Cybersecurity Basics: Protecting Your Digital Life

> My friend [Suhesh](https://suhesh.com.np/) is a cybersecurity professional who taught me what hacking really is and how to protect my privacy online. Here's what I learned about staying safe in the digital world.

## What is Hacking? Breaking the Myths

When most people think of "hacking," they imagine someone in a dark room wearing a hoodie, typing furiously to break into systems. But the reality is quite different.

### Types of Hackers

| Type | Description | Motivation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| White Hat | Ethical hackers who find vulnerabilities to fix them | Improving security |
| Black Hat | Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain | Money, data theft, damage |
| Grey Hat | Hackers who may break rules but without malicious intent | Recognition, challenge |
| Script Kiddies | Inexperienced hackers using pre-made tools | Fun, showing off |
| Hacktivists | Hack for political or social causes | Activism, awareness |

> "Hacking is not about breaking systems; it's about understanding them so deeply that you can make them do things they weren't designed to do." - Suhesh

## Common Hacking Techniques You Should Know About

Understanding how attacks happen helps you protect yourself better.

| Attack Type | How It Works | How to Protect Yourself |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Phishing | Fake emails/websites trick you into revealing information | Check URLs, don't click suspicious links |
| Password Attacks | Guessing or cracking passwords | Use strong, unique passwords |
| Malware | Malicious software that infects your device | Use antivirus, don't download from untrusted sources |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Intercepting communications between two parties | Use HTTPS websites, avoid public WiFi for sensitive tasks |
| Social Engineering | Manipulating people to reveal information | Verify identities, be skeptical of unusual requests |

## Password Management: Your First Line of Defense

One of the most important things I learned from Suhesh was to stop storing passwords in text files (which I used to do!).

### Why Password Managers Like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) Are Essential

Bitwarden is a free, open-source password manager that securely stores all your passwords.

#### Benefits of Using a Password Manager:

1. **Store unique passwords** for every site (no more reusing passwords!)
2. **Generate strong passwords** that are impossible to guess
3. **Auto-fill forms** so you don't have to type passwords
4. **Encrypt your data** so even if someone gets your password file, they can't read it
5. **Sync across devices** so your passwords are available everywhere

> "The best password is one you can't remember. Let a password manager remember it for you." - Suhesh

### How to Create a Strong Master Password

Your master password is the only one you need to remember, so make it strong but memorable.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use a passphrase with multiple words | Use single dictionary words |
| Include numbers and special characters | Use personal information (birthdays, names) |
| Make it at least 12 characters | Reuse passwords from other sites |
| Consider using a memorable sentence | Write it down where others can find it |

Example of a strong passphrase: `Horse-Battery-Staple-Coffee-92!`

## Protecting Your Privacy Online

Beyond passwords, there are many ways to protect your privacy online.

### Essential Privacy Practices

| Practice | Description | Difficulty Level |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Use a VPN | Encrypts your internet connection | Easy |
| Enable 2FA | Adds a second verification step | Easy |
| Review app permissions | Limit what apps can access | Medium |
| Use private browsing | Doesn't save browsing history | Easy |
| Check privacy settings | Review settings on social media | Medium |
| Use encrypted messaging | Apps like Signal for private chats | Easy |

### Browser Extensions for Privacy

These browser extensions can help protect your privacy while surfing the web:

1. **uBlock Origin** - Blocks ads and trackers
2. **Privacy Badger** - Automatically learns to block invisible trackers
3. **HTTPS Everywhere** - Ensures you use secure connections when available
4. **Cookie AutoDelete** - Automatically removes cookies when you close tabs

## Real-World Security Tips

Here are some practical tips I've implemented after learning from Suhesh:

1. **Check for HTTPS**: Look for the padlock icon in your browser before entering sensitive information
2. **Be careful with public WiFi**: Avoid banking or shopping on public networks
3. **Update regularly**: Keep your devices and apps updated with security patches
4. **Backup your data**: Follow the 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 different media types, 1 off-site)
5. **Use different email addresses**: Consider using different emails for different purposes

## What to Do If You've Been Hacked

Even with precautions, breaches can happen. Here's what to do:

| Step | Action | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Change passwords immediately | High |
| 2 | Enable 2FA where possible | High |
| 3 | Check for unauthorized activity | High |
| 4 | Update and scan for malware | Medium |
| 5 | Notify contacts if account was used to spam | Medium |
| 6 | Monitor credit reports if financial info was compromised | Medium |
| 7 | Report the incident to relevant platforms | Low |

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity doesn't have to be complicated. By taking a few simple steps like using a password manager like Bitwarden, enabling two-factor authentication, and being careful about what you share online, you can significantly improve your digital safety.

Remember that perfect security doesn't exist, but you can make yourself a much harder target by following these basic practices. Start with one change today - perhaps installing a password manager - and gradually improve your security habits over time.
